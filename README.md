# baby-bot
baby's first discord bot

This is a discord bot made initially as a learning project; it is a part of the discord server I've set up with friends of mine, and I add various functionalities as needed.

Commands:

....(Funtions cog)

!cat - returns a random cat picture! you can type something after '!cat' to search for that query instead of cat.

!marco - pings you with 'Polo!' from a different text channel.

!ping - Pong!

!roll - usage: !roll 4d6

!say - makes the bot say whatever you type after !say

!sleepy - turns bot off (confirm with a reply of 'y')

!teampicker - usage: !teampicker (team1size) (team2size) // returns numbers in the format [ 1, 2 ] vs [ 3, 4, 5 ] in random order to assign teams. Plans to optionally use names from an occupied voice channel instead.

!help - lists available commands

!help (command) - shows usage of given command

!help_printout - shows this message.''')

....(Minecraft cog)

!playercount - returns the number of players currently connected to the Baby Blue Minecraft server. Optionally takes the argument "names" to return the players' usernames as well (!playercount names).

TBD: Finish ist of commands and functionality.
